## About
This project is a web-app made for easily ordering food and drinks, requested by Caf√© Ex(c)uze to save time when collecting orders. They have a big terrace and having to walk twice to a customer is a frustrating part of their job. This web-app would make it possible to order drinks having to call a waiter first, effectively cutting their travel time in half.

## Requirements
**Must have**
- A mobile first webapp
- An organised list of the menu
- Ability to order menu entries
- Admin panel for editing items and categories

**Nice-to-have**
- Get the website and table number by scanning a QR-code
- Extra user info when ordering (name)
- Calculate and print the total price on the ticket
